        For my Beyond the Classroom assignment, I decided to explore the Museum Folkwang Online Collection. Specifically I decided to dive into the artwork of Caspar David Friedrich. I then decided to create a display of some of his artwork as a slideshow on a website. My website will connect historical art history of Friedrich and todays modern technolgy. The website showcases his art when you hover over the images or when you click 'start slideshow' button. Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) was a German Romantic painter known for his symbolic landscapes. He is considered one of the most important figures in the development of 19th century European art. Friedrich's work is closely associated with the Romantic movement, which emerged in Europe in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This movement was a reaction to the rationalism of the Enlightenment and the political and social upheaval of the time, including the aftermath of the French Revolution. Friedrich's art, with its emphasis on emotion and individualism. His artworks of landscapes often depict the German countryside, celebrating the beauty and grandeur of the German landscape. His works resonated with the idea of a unique German identity rooted in nature and history, contributing to the emerging sense of German nationalism. Friedrich's work was influenced by German Romantic philosophy Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He explored themes of nature and the individual's relationship to the world, which resonated with Friedrich's artistic vision. He witnessed the decline of the Holy Roman Empire. His art depicts the longing for stability, spirituality, and a connection to the past in the face of these tumultuous events. In summary, Caspar David Friedrich's artwork is deeply rooted in the cultural, historical, and philosophical context of Germany during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His paintings capture the essence of the Romantic movement and reflect the aspirations, ideals, and concerns of his time, including the longing for a deeper connection to nature, spirituality, and a unique German identity in a changing world.
