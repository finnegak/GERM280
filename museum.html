        For my Beyond the Classroom assignment, I decided to explore the Museum Folkwang Online Collection. Specifically I decided to dive into the artwork of Caspar David Friedrich. Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) was a prominent German Romantic painter known for his contemplative and symbolic landscapes. He is considered one of the most important figures in the development of 19th-century European art. Friedrich's work is often associated with the Romantic movement due to its emphasis on emotions, nature, and spirituality.
